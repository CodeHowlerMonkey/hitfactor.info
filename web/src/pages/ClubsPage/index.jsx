    You can filter by club in the classifier scores for now.
    <br />
    Some ideas:
    <ul>
      <li> List of All Shooters in the Club with different sorts</li>
      <li> All classifiers Club ever ran</li>
      <li>some graphs with activity / number of shooters?</li>
      <li>
        (maybe) all scores of classifiers merged together in one for
        cross-analysis
      </li>
      <li>(maybe) sister clubs? where shooters from this club also go</li>
    </ul>
  </UnderConstruction>
