# Importing

scripts/import.js overwrites data in the data/meta, data/ and data/imported folders.
It's using the same 4 spaces as tabs as original download, so it's both human readable and can
be compared using git.

For example for 2024 Production HHF changes see: https://github.com/CodeHowlerMonkey/hitfactorlol/commit/0e8fd49d163e59227a3c43b0e6c42aa15212c41a#diff-07e77667d7467dad8cd469842b136133f92468e6f5a841c4a11bf245b8565f31R5259
